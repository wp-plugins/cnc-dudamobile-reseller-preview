Add dudamobile previews on your wordpress page easy by using a shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin is for dudamobile resellers that have API access. It allows you to enter your api username and api password in the settings.  Then you can use a shortcode to display the mobile preview on any page.  This was only tested on WordPress version 3.8 so I cannot conifrm if it works on any past versions.  If it does please let me know.
