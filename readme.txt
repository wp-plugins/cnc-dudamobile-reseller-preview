Add duda mobile previews on your wordpress page easily by using a shortcode.



== Description ==

This plugin is for dudamobile resellers that have API access for the mobile sites (not duda one). It allows you to enter your api username and api password in the settings.  Then you can use a shortcode to display the mobile preview on any page.


All you need to make this work is to add the short code: [dudamobile_preview] to your page.  Remember to add your username and password under Settings in the admin.

The duda one api plugin will be released sometime July 2014 as a seperate plugin.

Features:

* Easy to use  (no coding required!)
* AJAX - preview loads without the page reloading
* Mobile - view the form on your moible device and see the mobile site (not the comparison)
* Design - design was minimal so it uses your templates css

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It's not working? =
Under the Settings there is a section to show jQuery or not (yes/no) if its not working change this and try it again. Now days most templates include jquery but some done so here you can toggle it on and off depending on your websites needs.


= Does this work with any Dudamobile plan =
It only works if you have a plan that has the Duda API access.

= It won't work, what could be wrong? =
In the settings you can turn debugging on or off.  If you turn it on you will see the debugging error message returned from the API. Common
errors are not updating the API Username & Password in the settings.

= Do I have to edit code to make this work? =
Absolutely not! Just install the plugin, add your api username & api password in the settings and then use the shortcode [dudamobile_preview]  Simple!


= Does this use all the API functions =
Not yet, this only creates the mobile comparison preview.  I will add more features as time allows.

= It just isn't working, what can I do? =
The best thing is to install an error log plugin and look at the error log.  If you have an error log you can send it to kevin@cncwebsolutions.com

= This is awesome, can I send you a donation? =
Yes! I truly spent a lot of time on this and would love a donation.  My paypal id is sales@cncwebsolutions.com  If you found this useful or better if it makes you money please don't forget about me :)
